# Security Aims and Objectives 

## Understanding Security Fundamentals

### CIA Triad

**Confidentiality**: Prevents the disclosure of data to unathorized people so only authorized people have access to the data; "need-to-know basis"
- Two types of Encryption:
  1. Symmetric: secret key
  2. Asymmetric: public key and private key

**Integrity**: Ensure data has not been tampered with. This is accomplished through hashing. You can encrypt the hash message and compare the beginning and ending hash. If the has is different then the data has been tampered with. 
- Two most common hashing algorithms: (The higher the number of bits, the more secure, and the lower the number, the faster it is.)
  1. 160-bit Secure Hash Algorithm Version 1 (SHA1).
  2. 128-bit Message Digest Version 5 (MD5). 

**Availability**: Ensure data is always available
  1. RAID - Redundant Array of Independant Disks, allows one or two disks to fail while still keeping the data accessible. 
  2. HVAC - YES that HVAC, Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning; regulates temperature for critical servers. 

Least Privelege
- A user has the most-limited access required to perform their role. Also "need-to-know basis".

Defense in Depth  
- Companies data is protect with a series of protective layers. If one layer fails to thrawt an attack the next layer will already be in place.
